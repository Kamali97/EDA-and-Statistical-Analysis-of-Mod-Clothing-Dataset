# EDA-and-Statistical-Analysis-of-Mod-Clothing-Dataset
Let’s assume you are working as a data scientist in a newly started textile company.
You have given a dataset that consists of most of the features related to the
measurements, clothes types, Product ID, User ID, etc. Now you suppose to work the
dataset to identify the patterns to understand the customer’s preferred brands and how
the company needs to brand its products based on the patterns that you will be found
them out. Explore all the EDA concepts you learned and use a statistical test to ensure
that your identification is true or false. 

This dataset contains self-reported clothing-fit feedback from customers as well as other
side information like reviews, ratings, product categories, catalog sizes, customers’
measurements (etc.) from 2 websites:
1. Mod Cloth
2. Rent the runway
1. Mod Cloth sells women’s vintage clothing and accessories, from which the
curator of the dataset collected data from three categories: dresses, tops, and bottoms.
2. Rent The Run Way is a unique platform that allows women to rent clothes for
various occasions; they collected data from several categories.

Goals
1. Using the core statistical theoretical concepts and knowledge to solve real time problem
statements.
2. Visualize a real time industry scenario where one can use these statistical concepts.
3. Detailed data analysis and number crunching using statistics.
4. Exhaustive report building using EDA and visualization techniques to help the business
take decisions using insights from the data.
